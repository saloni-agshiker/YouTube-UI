## 🎯 What it Does

Over winter break, I wanted to learn some web-dev / front-end programming languages like HTML and CSS. I followed this crash course video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc.
I learned about:
- Various HTML elements
- HTML structure
- Dividers
- Flexbox
- How to ensure responsive design
- CSS properties and Box Model
